# NewsApp was an instructor-assessed project on the Networking module of the Android Basics by Google Nanodegree.

The app displays recent news stories using The Guardian newspaper API. The app connects to the internet and regularly updates news itself on the given topic of Arsenal Football Club.

The technical guidelines of the project were to: 
 - Connecting to an API
 - Parse the response of the API
 - Handle error cases gracefully
 - Updating information regularly
 - Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
